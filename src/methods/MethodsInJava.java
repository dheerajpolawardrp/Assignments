//How to create method in Java?
	

	//1. Identify the duplicate code in your program that is going to complete a specific task.
	//2. Separate the duplicate code from each and every program and create a block outside of the main method and store duplicate code inside that.
	//3. Update each and every method block with meaningful names that reflect what tasks we are trying to complete.
	//4. Add the data-type before each and every method based on the data that we are expecting at the end.
	//5. Call the method inside the main method to execute the code.
	
	//Different types of methods in Java.
	
	//1. Method without return type.
	//2. Method with return type.
	//3. Method with parameters.
	//4. Method without parameters.
